spider-tool uses an extremely simple scheduler which does not use the alarm signal 
like most schedulers, but integrates with the poll call so that there are no 
race conditions at all.  Simplicity is the key to keeping spider-tool reliable.

For fairly complete descriptions of the functions in the scheduler, see the 
comments in sched.h
