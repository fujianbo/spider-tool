IO management routines are locate in io.c and io.h.  The spider-tool
centers around a poll() call on a set (possibly a large number) of file 
descriptors.  spd_io_add, spd_io_change, and spd_io_remove are used 
to manipulate this list.  Operating systems which do not support poll may use 
some sort of select() emulation.  spider-tool is designed to take advantage of 
this powerful system.

IO management is complicated by the fact that poll requires an array as its 
primary argument and provides no callback field.  Therefore, our data is 
basically stored in a parallel array, with the same index.  The ID number of 
the I/O event is then index into these arrays. 

This does present a problem because of removing entries.  That will tend to 
leave holes in the poll() array which can be filled by re-arranging the 
existing entries.  This, however, redefines the ID numbers, so for all 
manipulation, we use pointers to the ID numbers instead of actual integers.  
Using this double indirection method, all operations remain O(1), including 
delete!
